Dommert's Python Web Sockets with Client &amp; Server

Need to build this out a lot more. Just simple impletation of client and server running websockets with some basic functions built in like heartbeat and things.

I'll try and write more documentation later. 

Anyone feel free to contribut or collaborate. I also have a SocketIO impletation of similar app too. 
Next possibley a Redis messaging service.
